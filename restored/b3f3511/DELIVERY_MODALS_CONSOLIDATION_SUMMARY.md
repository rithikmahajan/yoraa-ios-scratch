# Delivery Modals Consolidation Summary

## Changes Made

### Files Consolidated
Successfully moved all delivery-related modal components into the main delivery screen:

1. **DeliveryOptionsModal.js** - Moved to `delivery.js`
2. **AddAddressModal.js** - Moved to `delivery.js` 
3. **AddressUpdatedModal.js** - Moved to `delivery.js`

### File Structure Changes

#### Before:
```
src/screens/
├── delivery.js
├── DeliveryOptionsModal.js
├── AddAddressModal.js
└── AddressUpdatedModal.js
```

#### After:
```
src/screens/
└── delivery.js (contains all delivery modals)
```

### Code Organization

#### Main Components Added to delivery.js:
1. **DeliveryOptionsModal** - Modal for selecting delivery options and managing delivery details
2. **AddAddressModal** - Modal for adding new delivery addresses with form inputs
3. **AddressUpdatedModal** - Success modal shown after address updates

#### Styles Added:
- `deliveryOptionsModalStyles` - Styles for the delivery options modal

### Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: All delivery-related functionality is now in one file
2. **Reduced Imports**: No need to import separate modal components
3. **Easier Maintenance**: All delivery modals can be modified in one place
4. **Consistent Styling**: Modal styles are co-located with main screen styles

### Implementation Details
